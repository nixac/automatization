# Preface

This repo may seem erratic with no documentation whatsoever.             
This is because resources listed here are part of a bigger private repository.              

You don't have to use anything from this repo to get games running as these are just there to make process feel more seamless.                

That being said part of a guide listed at pages may be harder to follow without any system integration whatsoever, therefore this repository exists, providing the minimal wrappers setup that should work with guide provided.              

If it doesn't, create a new issue here, as I may have forgotten to update some wrappers here.
